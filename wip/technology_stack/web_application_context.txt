Important because this knowledge is not trivial and not always easy to find that this is the problem in case of certain issues.

Got the solution to my pb.
 
As you know, we have 2 app context:
 - the root web app context loaded by the ContextLoaderListener (spring.xml)
 - the Dispatcher servlet one (spring-servlet.xml) which become a child app context of the first one. 
 
From the dispatcher servlet context, you can see beans defined in the root context (a Service can be injected to a Controller).
But not the other way, that's the way the parent - child app context is working in Spring.
 
Now:
 
I defined my "Pli" bean in the spring-servlet context file.
In my jsp, I was loading the wrong app context file using the 
org.springframework.web.context.support.WebApplicationContextUtils.getWebApplicationContext

This loads the root app context...

To have access to the Dispatcher servlet one, I had to use the 

org.springframework.web.servlet.support.RequestContextUtils.getWebApplicationContext

which return the dispatcher serlvet context.

Something to put on the wiki...

Et voil≈ï!
