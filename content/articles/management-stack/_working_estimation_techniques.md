Estimation is never commitment: ref: Scheduling-EN.

Under promiss and over deliver.

The only benefits of story point is that people are better in relative estimates then in absolute numbers. But is is prooven that even with a short training (1-2 hours) everyone can be a good enough estimator. (how to measue enything)

Instead of story points
-------------------------

Instead of story points you should use calendar based estimates with proper risk management and (semi-)automatic estimation adjustment.


Here are techniques which are working to me.

### Technique: periodic re-estimation

Just go for it. Once you have more knowledge just review and adapt you estimation. It was always much faster then the forst time when you ahd to spend most of your time on understanidng the problem. On re-estimation you already know the problem. 

Several months of work can be reviewed/re-estimated in 1 hour with team. It measn it can be really frequent. My experience is that after the first or second re/estimation no more re-estimation is needed because the domin become clear the estimations are becoming less risky.

### Technique: automatic estimation adjustment.

1. Do estimate in single number
2. during development collect effort spent
3. after task completed adjust compute average deviation from estimate
4. apply deviation to remaining task

Adapting to experience change
No re-estimation
Simple
Automatic
Working very well in practice


Variation:
- adjust by task size categories. Adjust 1d of work based on completed 1d tasks only. works estomated to 5d is adjusted by completed work estimated to 5d. etc.
- adjust by developer: compute developer to developer.

### Technique: automatic estimation adjustment with Monte Carlo simulation

See "How to measure anything"
Plus beats cognitive biasses (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias)

BDW it is working with story points too see why: http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/how-do-story-points-relate-to-hours

### Technique: Expert estimation

The "black art" estimation is describing as very effective technique of estimation. 

What it is: take expert of domain with team knowledge and let him estimate. It is against the commonaly agreed approach to estimate by developers who will really do the job. But it can be really cost effective (less time consuming) to do good enough estimates. 

Restrictions:

- expert of the domain (to know the what)
- expert of technology (to know the how)
- experience in team who will developer (to know how to adjust to reality)

### Technique: M-L-M Estimation

(min + 4 x likely + max)/ 6

Very powerful with Monte carlo simulation.
