Jevgeni Kabanov - Data-Driven Software Engineering 
Deliver Quality software on time :)
Reality: Onley 60% deliver on time  and half of releases crashes in production
Solution: Measure and experiment (sound Agileish)
Wha tis metter: predictibility productivity and quality for softweare eng, team. And well measurable metrics (except productivity)
From large statistical data.
Having standup has 4% more predictibility and similarly small numbers on other aspects.
Meeting several times a week has negative effect on quality. -  Disctraction.
Who estimates? If management is resented -6% in predictibility. -3% on quality. the opposite when the whole team is presented - all engineer.
Who tests? Developer tests +5% in quality. Automtated test 8% predictibility, +3% quality. Testers doing testing does not really makes difference.
Code reviews: Enormous boost (17-22%) on predictibility, not a big boost on quiality, code reviews is improving your architecture, not neccerely decrease number of bugs, 
Good data to sell to mamagment.
Automated test: "Fuctionality covered by automate test = not code coverage". Significant 15-25% gain in predictibility and quality. Nothing  else is increasing quality as much as automated tests.
Pair up: 7% predictibility, 13% in quality. - But code review are much better in predictibility but worst in quality. In general Code review is more valuable.
Code quality: "Fix all code quality metrics - e.g. Sonar", 17% predictibility, 13% in quality. So set it up for all your project. And very cheap to monitor.
Tools: how tools effect. version control 9% predictibility, ide 8%, issue tracker 5%, etc But the specific tool itself  is not effecting too much. Except JRebel +8%.

Measure: Desdline misses, Scope changes, Blocker issues after release, User satisfaction.

Gerard Meszaros - Find the Right Abstraction Level for Your Tests 
Goog good, but difficult to extract essence.

Differnetece  external and internal quality. Internal quality a kind of subjective. Extrernal quality whihc is noticable only.
Extrenal qualit like: goal achieved. tipically business goal.
REffere to E.Myth revisited (A vállallkozás mitosza). And apply that concept to software development.
Offshore: use concept from 4 hours workweek book. Offshore whihc is freeing up you ding important things.
Automate or find someone who is thinking and will aitomate.

Amber Case - Getting Things Done at Scale 
1/50 has a good experience in acquisition of an company.
Why:
- Crippling managment/overhaad to get simple things done
- Founder flight: charismatic, visionary leader is living fast.
- Lack of detailed transition plan
- Loss of   passion for original product
- Left of respect and cross-compromise.
- Culture clash 
- Jealousy/blocking from parent company employees
- Sprinters vs  Marathon runners
How to handle
1. Pre-ngotiate
  - Do not leave details for later and hope they work
  - Be as detailed as possible and get corporate bayoff 
  - do not be vague. Vaguness  breeds confusion nad paranoia.
2. Predetermine your desired outcome
  - Creatre and lead a transiton plan
  - retain pasion for original product
  - help parent company to sprint
  - adopt traits of a marthon runner
  - maintain and  improve team quality
4. Over communication - Lack of communication with new or remote team leads to suspection and insecurity.
5. Win friends and influence team
...
Several social (read a book about it)
and orginazational stuff which is a little bit common sense...
Growing:
- Hire slowly
- Litmus test

Agile team don't necesserily create agile software architectures.
Agile architecture is reacting to changes easily. (e.g microservices - giving flexibility)
How do we inspect software architecture
  - read code - so much to read
  - pucture 
    - how? 
    - TEam arent able to visualize softwasre architecture effectively
      - difficult to write a single diagram: multiple diagramm need to be created
Think how to align your code to the architecture.
Even if BUD is forgotten it is replaced by nothing.
So 
- create highl level BUD in the bggining. Significant decision (here you have to design about messageing , micorservice, async or sync etc.) - helps sharing understaning of system.
- Plus you have to identify and mmitigate your highest priority risks
- up front design including technology. Technology choise is effecting your architecture

De csak ennyi semmi több.... uff
A többi csak szarakodás

MB: not even checking changes when updating project so he could not learning from others development effort.
