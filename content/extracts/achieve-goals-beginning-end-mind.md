<blockquote> <p>That’s why it’s important to begin with the end in mind. <strong>Instead of taking the most obvious route, take a step back and get a complete picture of the goal</strong>. Then ask yourself: <strong>what are the possible ways to achieve the goal?</strong> Notice that the question is not whether or not there is other way because there are always other ways. The question helps you find new possibilities you might never think of before.</p> <p><strong>You can take the concept further by questioning the goal itself</strong>. Why? Because a goal is just a way to achieve an even bigger goal.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="http://www.lifeoptimizer.org/2009/05/07/achieve-goals-by-beginning-with-the-end-in-mind/">Original</a></p>
