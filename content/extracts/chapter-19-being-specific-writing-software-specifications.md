    <li>I&rsquo;ve never known any trouble that an hour&rsquo;s reading didn&rsquo;t assuage.</li>
    <li>Used correctly, specifications oil the development process.</li>
    <li>Not just the existence, but also the quality of software specifications is vital to the software development process.</li>
    <li><strong>Specifications are an important communication mechanism for software developers. </strong>Use them to capture information that must not be lost or forgotten.</li>
    <li>With all important facts written down, there&rsquo;s less risk when people leave the project: The amount of information loss will be minimized, and there will be a solid base to help any replacement programmer get up to speed.</li>
    <li>All information is conveniently recorded in a known place. New people can join your project and understand what each component does and how they fit together, just by reading the documentation.</li>
    <li><strong>The requirements for a project are never clear at first; </strong>customers can&rsquo;t tell you exactly what they want their software to do (they&rsquo;re not computer experts, so they don&rsquo;t know).</li>
    <li>The customer must agree to and sign off on the requrements specification; it forms an effective contract between the software developer and its client.</li>
    <li>When the requested software is finally built, the customer realizes that what it asked for wasn&rsquo;t what it actually wanted: Rewrite it in pink.</li>
    <li>Sadly, many software factories skip requirements gathering or do not give it sufficient import. It&rsquo;s vital to agree on the requirements early on, before software design has started and certainly before any code has been written.</li>
    <li>Software requirements must be captured early to set expectations, to prevent feature creep, and to reduce developer angst.</li>
    <li>If your software task is not adequately specified, don&rsquo;t start coding until you&rsquo;ve written a functional specification, and people agree that it&rsquo;s correct.</li>
    <li>Use literate programming tools to write your technical documentation. Don&rsquo;t write a word-processed document that will quickly go stale.</li>
    <li>If a specification can be interpreted in more than one way, then the &ldquo;specification&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t specific&mdash;it&rsquo;s not doing its job.</li>
    <li>An effective specification is inviting to read and easy to understand.</li>
    <li><strong>The best specifications are written from the perspective of the reader, not the writer</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>A specification should be self-contained and complete.</strong></li>
    <li>The contents of a specification must, therefore, be <strong>verifiable</strong>.</li>
    <li>Nothing is set in stone, neither code nor documents.</li>
    <li>Think about the contents of your specification as you write it. Choose a structure and vocabulary that the audience will understand, and make sure that the document is correct, complete, and self-describing.</li>
    <li>Writing usually works best when there is <strong>one author per document.</strong></li>
    <li>The author must be the right person. e.g. The marketing department doesn&rsquo;t write your functional specification;</li>
    <li>Each document must have a defined owner who takes responsibility for it.</li>
    <li><strong>Document review is important</strong></li>
    <li>Once you&rsquo;ve finished the specification, don&rsquo;t forget about it.<strong> Keep it alive</strong> and up to date.</li>
    <li><strong>Saving time by avoiding specifications is almost certainly a false economy</strong>; specifications help to save time communicating. When you write a specification, you only have to describe how the program works once. If you skip this step, at least the same amount of communication happens anyway, but on an  ad hoc basis&mdash;over a longer space of time and in a less controlled manner. This communication is far less effective and will actually take longer, because you will have to explain the same things over and over again with a slightly different spin for each audience.</li>
    <li>It is dangerous and unprofessional to avoid writing specifications. If there isn&rsquo;t enough time to write a specification, there probably isn&rsquo;t enough time to write the code.</li>
</ul>
