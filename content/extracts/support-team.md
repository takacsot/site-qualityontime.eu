<p>how to handle &quot;critical&quot; issues.</p>
<!--break-->
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>If these critical issues are bugs or defects, and they happen often... then it's time to have some courage and discipline and go upstream and ask difficult questions. <b>WHY are these things happening, and HOW can they be reduced in frequency?</b> Instead of adapting to handle them, go to the source and stop them. If you can't because &quot;they&quot; are a different group under different management, then you aren't in an agile organization.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>If they don't happen very often, then this is a simple answer. <b>Let the product owner decide</b> whether the item is more important than items currently in the sprint. If it is, then it should be estimated and should displace a set of stories that are lower priority and of equal cumulative value.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Work <b>one week sprints</b>. As a support team, you need the ability to be more flexible. Shorter sprints allow for quicker reaction and re-prioritization. Also, work can't stagnate without being noticed. Deployment is quicker (although you might deploy daily and not wait for the sprint end).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Think about applying <b>Kanban</b>. Loosen the strict requirements of scrum and use Kanban to drive how many things you have in flight at a time. Use iterations as a measurement and assessment tool, and use Kanban to drive priority and work. Walking the board will put the daily focus on priorities.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
