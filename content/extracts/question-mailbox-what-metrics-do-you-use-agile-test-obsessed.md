- The problem is that traditional measures don’t work in Agile.
- Requirements coverage is meaningless if the definition of “Done” includes tested. 
- Test pass/fail ratios are not useful. If a test that was passing starts failing, the team stops and fixes the regression right away.
- Counting the defects found internally is not particularly helpful,
- First, I only use metrics to get a 50,000 foot view on what’s going on. 
- Second, I do not use metrics to compare teams or individuals.
- The best way to screw up the usefulness of any process metric is to use it to judge people.
- Given all that, here’s the list of what I do use:
- The core measure I use is velocity, or Running Tested Features
- I sometimes look at cycle time (the time it takes from when a story moves from To Do into In Progress to the time it’s Done). 
- I do measure code coverage on the unit tests.
- I do pay attention to defects reported from the field. If there are enough of them, counting might be useful.
- I use the Continuous Integration system to tell me about the health of the build.
