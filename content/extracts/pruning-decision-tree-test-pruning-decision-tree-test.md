Great testing is more about deciding what not to test than deciding what to test.

- Breadth of coverage – Often times it is best to try everything a little rather than some things very deep and others not at all. 
- Scenario coverage – Look for test cases which will intersect the primary use patterns of the users. 
- Risk analysis – What areas of the product would be most problematic if they went wrong?
- Cost of servicing – If forced to choose, spend more time on the portions that will be more difficult or costly to service if a bug shows up in the field.
- Testing cost – While not a good criteria to use by itself, if a test is too expensive to carry out or to automate, perhaps it should be skipped in favor of writing many more tests that are much cheaper. 
- Incremental gains – How much does this test case add to existing coverage? It is better to try something wholly new than another slight variation on an existing case.
