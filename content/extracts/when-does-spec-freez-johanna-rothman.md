> I asked him, “When does the spec freeze now?” He smiled, and pointed to his “Design freeze” gate on his process picture. “I bet you a coffee that you can ask any developer here and that they cannot point to one spec that didn’t change after that or any spec that was right at the end of the project.” He took the bet.

> Over the next two days, he asked every developer he encountered. Some of them laughed at the question. “The specs are never right. They freeze, but they should change.” One project manager said, “I can’t remember a project where we actually froze a spec for more than a day or two.”
