## Peter Smith - It doesn't work like that in enterprise

Definition of Enterprise development

Problems:

- Constrained process and practices (sometime the lack of it)
  - As long as a sub-optimal processes profitable, it will be allowed to continue (Otto: so you(!) have to prove that you change is more profitable)
  - Take Control
    - Don't stop being lay developer (automate)
    - If you tru had enough there will be ways in which you can speed yourself up
    - Consider committing your own time (!!!!!)
    - Keep innovating, and do not give up.
- Planning for the future
  - Most enterprise is planning for the future to some extend
  - Fire-fighting is much more common than working proactively
  - Sometime there is no management of technical dept at all
  - it can be very difficult to communicate the true value of writing/refactoring code to be loose coupled and maintainable
  - Take control
    - Start the conversation! - Yes it is politics...
    - Lead by Example
    - ask your architect or development manager what the `self-life` of your software is (Otto - do not really get this advice ????)
- Rejection of industry standard knowledge
  - Companies tend to shy away from buy to things they perceive as teny
  - Individuals often try to dins the cleverest solution and ignore the simple one right in from the them,
  - Most teams should be able to react quickly to client demands regardless of their processes of failing in other areas.
  - Take control
    - Share your knowledge
    - Demonstrate (cool) useful things
    - Know the _why_ as well as the _what_ and the _how_
    - Help people to find the art and the joy in coding
- Management and people
  - Developers often treated as liability rather than a resource
  - Staff are often "promoted" based on length of service rather than proficiency and suitability for the role
  - People with responsibility tend to subconsciously protect their position and their interest
  - Take control
    - Remain true to yourself and uphold your own standard (be proud of it)
    - Say no
    - The golden rule: " Am I still learning skills that will be relevant to me in my future career?"

What is the solution?
