##Doc Norton - Agile Metrics - Velocity is NOT the Goal 260249179.mp4
VElicity is not a really good indicator of team performance and health
The only important: The which is measured will improve... at cost. (Otto: So the only meaningfull measurement is business value.)
Any objsevert statisticsal regularity will fail as soon as it is used as a target.
When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be  a good measure....an unintrnded result, contrary to interests of the incentive makers.
!!!!Not finished yet!!!
