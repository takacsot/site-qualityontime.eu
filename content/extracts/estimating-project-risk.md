<p><strong>Projects requiring six months to deliver valuable working software should automatically be considered medium to high risk of outright failure. <br />

<strong>Long odds for long deliveries </strong><br />
<br />
Projects that invest twelve months or more before there is a return have extremely high failure rates. I believe they are at least 100 times more likely to fail than projects that can deliver valuable working software in two-month units. These projects should be considered extremely high risk. <br />

<strong>Long projects don&rsquo;t have to have long delivery cycles </strong></p>
<p><strong>Control the delivery cycle and you have controlled the risk </strong></p>
