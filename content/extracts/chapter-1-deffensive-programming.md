<ul>
    <li>Assume nothing. Unwritten assumptions continually cause faults, particularly as code grows.</li>
    <li>Employ a Good Coding Style and Sound Design</li>
    <li>Don&rsquo;t Code in a Hurry</li>
    <li>Trust no one. Absolutely anyone&mdash;including yourself&mdash;can introduce flaws into your program logic.  Treat all inputs and all results with suspicion until you can prove that they are valid.</li>
    <li>Write Code for Clarity, Not Brevity</li>
    <li>Keep it simple (KISS)</li>
    <li>If it can&rsquo;t be maintained, your code is not safe.</li>
    <li>Simplicity is a virtue. Never make code more complex than necessary.</li>
    <li>Compile with All Warnings Switched On: Compiler warnings catch many silly coding errors. Always enable them. Make sure your code compiles silently.</li>
    <li>Use Static Analysis Tools</li>
    <li>Use Safe Data Structures</li>
    <li>Check Every Return Value</li>
    <li>Handle Memory (and Other Precious Resources) Carefully</li>
    <li>Treat all scarce resources with respect. Manage their acquisition and release carefully.</li>
    <li>Initialize All Variables at Their Points of Declaration</li>
    <li>Declare Variables as Late as Possible: and do not use the same variable for sematically different way.</li>
    <li>Use a Good Diagnostic Logging Facility</li>
    <li>Providing default behavior, especially if it is erroneouse.</li>
    <li>Checking numeric limits</li>
    <li>Make everything as const as you possibly can (final, in java)</li>
    <li>Make Preconditions, postconditions, invariants, assertions</li>
</ul>
