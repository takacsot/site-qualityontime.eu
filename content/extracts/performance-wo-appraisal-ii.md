>In order to improve, people need information--specific examples of behavior or results, along with the impact of the behavior or result.

<!--break-->

>Examples from months ago aren't helpful. Either the person won't remember the incident, or they'll wonder why the manager waited so long to bring it up.
>A reasonable person might conclude that his manager doesn't want him to be successful.

>Bell curves, ratings, and rankings do not improve organizational performance. In fact, they can damage performance.

>Most people believe their work is above average. It's called the Enhancement Effect. Telling someone he is below average results in a defense response, so he won't be really hearing the rest of the message.

>People accept feedback when these four things are true:

>- _The source is reliable_
>- _The receivers trusts the givers intentions_
>- _The receiver has a chance to clarify (being permitted to put a written rebuttal in a personnel folder doesn't meet the intention of this point)_
>- _The process is fair--both how the feedback is developed and how it's delivered_
