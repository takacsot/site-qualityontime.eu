Kill Distractions

- Distractions kill your focus on the problem at hand, making you less productive.
- The higher the level of concentration, the denser the ideas.
- When others see you wearing headphones, they are less likely to interrupt you.
- For visual distractions, turn off all the things on your machine that break your concentration.
- Turn Off Needless Notifications Balloon tipsin
- lots of overlapping windows
- “black out” the background, making all the applications you are not using fade out. This keeps your focus tightly bound to the task at hand.

Create quiet time

- consider instituting “quiet time,”
- During this time, everyone has their email turned off, there are no meetings, and it is verboten to call or go talk to someone unless there is an emergency
