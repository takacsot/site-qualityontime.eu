> There is a notion - a wrong notion - that the critical path is the path through the network of activities with zero slack. If you have a zero slack network, you're late before you start.

> All IMPORTANT items in your project need protection. That protect is called schedule margin.

> In the scheduling world, NEVER have the important work on the critial path without schedule margin.

So In The End

- No schedule margin - you're late
- Never put important stuff on the critical path with schedule margin
- Plan all work, never leave anything left over to do when you have free time
- It's the off critical path items that will kill your project when they get on the critical path because you weren't watching them. Watch everything, all the time.
- Use Monte Carlo - all project numbers are random numbers. Knowing the Probability Distribution Function is the start, then knowing the drivers - things that push other things - and their PDF's provide decision points about keeping things off the path.
