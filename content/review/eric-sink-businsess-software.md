Time has passed now I found this book. The book is about start a business, a small ISV (independent software vendor). What is special in such a company: the product. It is a software. Plus a typical founder of such a companies are geeks, software developers. And that is my world. :)<br />
<br />
It covers several topics from collected potential business ideas, starting the company, marketing and sales.<br />
<br />
Originally all these sections are publishes in his <a href="http://www.ericsink.com">weblog</a> but this book is still valuable it a systematic and organizes set of articles and (as a total) a book.<br />
<br />
Valuable for everyone.</p>
