<ul>
    <li>Learn to name things transparently&mdash;an object&rsquo;s name should describe it clearly.</li>
    <li>The key to good naming is to understand exactly what you&rsquo;re naming. Only then can you give a meaningful name. If you can&rsquo;t invent a good name for something, do you really know what it is, or even if it should exist at all?</li>
    <li>When naming, favor clarity over brevity.</li>
    <li>Name things well the first time, all the time.</li>
    <li>Meaningful function names avoid the words be, do, and perform. These are classic traps for beginners trying to consciously include verbs (this function does XXX . . . ). They are just noise and don&rsquo;t add any value to the name.</li>
    <li>Name functions from an external viewpoint, with a doing phrase. Describe the logical operation, not the implementation.</li>
    <li>Avoid redundant words in names. Specifically, avoid these words in type names: class, data, object, and type.</li>
    <li>Choose a consistent naming convention&mdash;and use it consistently.</li>
</ul>
