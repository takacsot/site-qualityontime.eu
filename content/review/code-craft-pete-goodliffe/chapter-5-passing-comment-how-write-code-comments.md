<ul>
    <li>Learn to write enough comments, and no more. Favor quality, not quantity.</li>
    <li>Spend your time writing code that doesn&rsquo;t need to be propped up by tons of comments.</li>
    <li>Bad comments are worse than no comments at all</li>
    <li>Good comments <em>explain why not how</em>.</li>
    <li>Don&rsquo;t duplicate code in a comment.</li>
    <li>When you find yourself writing dense comments to explain your code, step back. Is there a bigger problem to solve?</li>
    <li>Think about what you&rsquo;re writing in a comment; don&rsquo;t type without using your brain. Read it back again in the context of the code. Does it contain the right information?</li>
</ul>
