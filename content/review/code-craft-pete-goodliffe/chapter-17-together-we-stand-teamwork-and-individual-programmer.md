<ul>
    <li>Both the interactions within and outside your development team will affect the code you produce. Notice how they affect your work.</li>
    <li>A team&rsquo;s organization has an inevitable affect on the code it produces.</li>
    <li>Organize your team around the code you&rsquo;re building, not your code around the team.</li>
    <li>Teamwork Tools: bugtracking syste, groupware, source control, methodology, project plan,</li>
    <li>Team diseases:&nbsp;
    <ul>
        <li>Tower of Babel: communication problem</li>
        <li>Dictatorship: generally an technical expert and a bag of &quot;yes&quot;-people.</li>
        <li>Development Democracy</li>
        <li>Satellite Station: teams in phisically different places</li>
        <li>The Grand Canyon: This team is comprised of members whose skill levels and experience lie at oppostite ends of the spectrum. Team members are not mixing.</li>
        <li>Quicksand: One member weakness can destroy the team productivity. Workaround: don't be that.</li>
        <li>Lemmings</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To be a high-quality programmer, you must be a high-quality team player.</li>
    <li>Clear lines of effective communication are vital to a well-functioning team. They must be established and cultivated. A good programmer is able to communicate well.</li>
    <li>No programmer owns any part of the codebase. Everyone in the team has access to the whole code and can modify it as is appropriate.</li>
    <li>Define lots of small milestones as short-term goals, and celebrate when you hit them.</li>
    <li>Define responsibilities</li>
    <li>Avoid burnout</li>
    <li>No team should have impossible goals.</li>
    <li>Mix up people&rsquo;s jobs; don&rsquo;t force someone to repeatedly do the same kind of task until they get bored and give up. Give everyone a chance to learn and to develop new skills.</li>
    <li>Successful teams are grown and run on purpose; they don&rsquo;t happen by accident.</li>
    <li>Don&rsquo;t lose information when people leave a team. Perform a hand-over, and capture all important knowledge from team members. Include all code documentation, test harnesses, and maintenance instructions.</li>
    <li>Use fewer and better people.</li>
    <li>Fit tasks to capability, and also to motivation.</li>
    <li>Invest in people. Technology moves fast; don&rsquo;t leave their skills out of date. Otherwise they&rsquo;ll move somewhere where they will gain better experience.</li>
    <li>Don&rsquo;t cultivate experts.</li>
    <li>Select complementary people.</li>
    <li>Remove failures.</li>
</ul>
