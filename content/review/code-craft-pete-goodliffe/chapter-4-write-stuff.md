<ul>
    <li>Don&rsquo;t write code that needs to be propped up by external documentation. It&rsquo;s flimsy. Ensure that your code reads clearly on its own.</li>
    <li>Write your code to be read. By humans. Easily. The compiler will be able to cope.</li>
    <li>Write Simple Code with Good Presentation&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Choose Meaningful Names</li>
    <li>Decompose into Atomic Functions</li>
    <li>Avoid magic numbers. Use well-named constants instead.</li>
    <li>Don&rsquo;t return nonsensical errors. Present the appropriate information in each context.</li>
    <li>Only add comments if you can&rsquo;t improve the clarity of the code in any other way.</li>
    <li>Don&rsquo;t document bad code&mdash;rewrite it.</li>
</ul>
