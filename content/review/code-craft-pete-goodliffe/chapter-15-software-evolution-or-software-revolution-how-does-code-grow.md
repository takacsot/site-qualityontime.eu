    <li>There is a misconception that software only develops during its initial stages of life. <em>The maintenance phase of software development  is always the longest.</em></li>
    <li>B.W. Boehm, a respected computer science professor, observed that 40 to 80 percent of total development time is spent in maintenance. (Boehm 76)</li>
    <li>Brooks found that as many as <em>40 percent of fixes introduced new faults</em>. (Brooks 95)</li>
    <li>Be aware of how easily code degrades as it is modified. Don&rsquo;t be satisfied with changes that leave the system in a worse state.</li>
    <li>Learn to detect putrid code. Know the warning signs and handle rotten code with the utmost care.</li>
    <li>Code conscientiously. Good programmers care more about how their code will look after a few years&rsquo; work than how much effort it takes to write now.</li>
    <li>Write new code with a view to its modifiability. Make it readable, extensible, and simple.</li>
    <li>If it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it.</li>
    <li>Manage changes carefully. Make sure you know who else is trying to modify code near where you&rsquo;re working.</li>
    <li>Review sensitive changes, especially in the run-up to a release. Even the simplest change can break other code.</li>
    <li>Try not to introduce extra dependencies with newly added code.</li>
    <li>Carefully test any modification you make, no matter how simple. It&rsquo;s really easy for silly faults to slip past unnoticed.</li>

</ul>
