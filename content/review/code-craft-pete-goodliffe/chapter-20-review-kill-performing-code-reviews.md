    <li>A review places source code under the microscope&mdash;really aiming to criticize and verify it.</li>
    <li><em>Code reviews are excellent tools to detect and eliminate hard-to-find bugs</em>, to increase code quality, to enforce collective code responsibility, and to spread knowledge.</li>
    <li>As we write a system, we need to ask whether to review the code and, if so, exactly which code to review.</li>
    <li>Select the code you review carefully. If you can&rsquo;t review everything, make informed choices about review candidates. Don&rsquo;t guess&mdash;you might waste your precious time.</li>
    <li>No one&rsquo;s code is above review and peer scrutiny. Actively invite review of your code.</li>
    <li><em>The success of a code review depends heavily on the author and reviewers adopting a positive attitude.</em> The aim of a review is to collaboratively improve the code, not to apportion blame or to justify implementation decisions.</li>
    <li><em>If you don&rsquo;t know what good code looks like, then you can&rsquo;t make a valid judgment of other people&rsquo;s work.</em></li>
</ul>
